-- Welcome to my neovim config!

-- The config is written in Lua and has been split into multiple files. The
-- `require` call at the top of this file will load all the settings. I'm using
-- Packer for managing the plugins. Their website explains how to install the
-- plugin manager and how to download the plugins.

-- All the config files are placed in ~/.config/nvim/lua/gradox. When calling
-- `require`, Lua will look for files in the lua folder. It seems that neovim
-- users with Lua configs have an additional folder inside the lua folder. I
-- think this is to namespace the config files to avoid any namespace issues
-- with native Lua libraries.
